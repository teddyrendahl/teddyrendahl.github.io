<a href="https://github.com/teddyrendahl/ugradrs">ugradrs</a> is a tiny Autograd engine inspired by Andrej Karpathy's <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd">micrograd</a> implemented in Rust. Intended as a personal exploration of the mechanics of neural networks, the repository allows for the creation of a DAG of scalar value operations with a small Pytorch-like API wrapper. The example in the repository uses a small Neural Network to perform classification
on sklearn's <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.make_moons.html">make moons</a> dataset.
