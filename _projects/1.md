Five flat mirrors are responsible for delivering X-ray light to the endstations
at LCLS. Due to X-ray light's tendency to completely transmit through a
material, the mirrors can only just slightly adjust the trajectory of the beam.
This means to see an appreciable change the optics need to placed quite far
from the instrumentation where they are delivering light. This required a
mechatronic system capable of manipulating the mirror surface on a nanoradian
scale. I designed the entire stack of software to operate the actuators that
controlled the mirror, from the configuration of motor drives to the high level
automation software that assisted operator's during alignment.
