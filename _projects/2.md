This <a href="https://github.com/teddyrendahl/ainyt">repository</a> contains solutions for a number of the games available on the New York Times' website. Each uses
different algorithmic techniques but all utilize browser automation to progress through the various puzzles.
Currently the repository contains a solution for the Wordle game by using an estimate of guess quality based on Information Theory. It also has a solver for the Mini Crossword that feeds clues to ChatGPT's API.
