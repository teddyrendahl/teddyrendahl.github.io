Operators at LCLS deal with a huge quantity of graphical user interfaces to
perform experiments. As part of the L2S-I project, both the underlying platform
and the overall design process of screens is being re-examined. In my role as
the User Experience Lead Engineer I am the intermediary between scientific
staff and their engineering resources. I manage both the feedback that
scientists have about user experience along with the PyQt software that
composes the screens. This process has created successful applications to view
the beamline such as the interface demoed above.
