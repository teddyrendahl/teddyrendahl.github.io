Samples at LCLS are often delivered via a streaming liquid jet. In the past,
operator would have to pay constant attention as small changes in the sample
environment can cause the liquid stream to drift from the interaction point.
Using a combination of machine vision and statistical analysis, my team is
working automatically adjusting the nozzle position to account for this
instablitity.
