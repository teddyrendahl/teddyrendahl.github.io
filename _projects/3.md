Samples at LCLS are often delivered via a streaming liquid jet. In the past,
an operator would have to pay constant attention as small changes in the sample
environment can cause the liquid stream to drift from the interaction point.
Using a combination of machine vision and statistical analysis, my team
developed an automated adjustment for the nozzle position to account for this
instability.
