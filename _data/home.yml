        Understanding how users approach interfaces for complex tasks requires
        a mix of compassion, abstraction and vision. I enjoy the creativity and
        interpersonal challenges involved in creating simple displays for
        intricate processes. What makes me unique is having the technical
        background to take what starts as mere sketches to robust applications.

        Design software to help experimenters understand the inner workings of
        molecules on a femtosecond scale. The most interesting points of
        exploration have been in automation and data visualization.
        Specifically, how those two systems intertwined can help with operation
        of complex instrumentation.

        I earned my Bachelor Degree in Applied Physics at UC Santa Cruz. The
        breadth of courses in the discipline allowed me to follow interests
        from General Relativity to Electrical Engineering. While there I also
        worked closely on a Python based simulation suite for to estimate the
        stochastic variation over distant galaxies life spans. The work not
        only received the <strong/>Undergraduate Research Award</strong>, but
        was my first foray into the power of scientific computing.
