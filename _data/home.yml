        Earned my Bachelor Degree in Applied Physics at UC Santa Cruz. The
        breadth of courses in the discipline allowed me to follow interests
        from General Relativity to Electrical Engineering. While there I also
        worked closely on a Python based simulation suite for to estimate the
        stochastic variation over distant galaxies life spans. The work not
        only received the <strong/>Undergraduate Research Award</strong>, but
        was my first foray into the power of scientific computing.
